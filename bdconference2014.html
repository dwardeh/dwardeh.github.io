        <h1><small>November 9, 2014</small> Breaking Development Conference</h1>
      </div>
	  <p class="lead">
		The Free Food, snacks, and vendor prizes were absolutely amazing... at some other conference that wasn't this one. As a matter of fact, I 
		even had to pay for my own parking at $20 a day. Actually, they did have a hot breakfast and coffee so it wasn't that bad. Plus,
		I did get to hear more f-bombs in 2 days than I did my junior year of high school. The <a href="https://bdconf.com/speakers/" target="_blank">speakers</a>
		where terrific and I came away with some inspiration so all was not lost.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	   I took the top few themes from the speakers and foolishly tried to summarize them in my own way as if I discovered them myself below.

	  <h4>Progressive Enhancement</h4>
	  <p>
	  
With a little planning you can make your websites work on all browsers, old and new. To make this happen, 
you’ll use progressive enhancement. The key 
to progressive enhancement is fault tolerance. Both HTML and CSS are fault tolerant, for example when adding an 
html tag that the browser doesn’t understand, the page is still rendered gracefully. Or when you add a style sheet 
attribute that isn’t available for the browser, it simply doesn’t get applied and it doesn’t break in the middle 
so styles before and after continue to work. This is a good thing because we can take advantage of both old and 
new features in one document. With progressive enhancement, basic html is written first making it more likely to 
work across all browsers. Then after a good shallacking, add in your really cool html and css enhancements that 
only work on modern browsers. 
</p>
<p>
Here’s an example of a datalist that uses predictive input for newer browsers. For browsers that don't support datalist
 a combobox and an input for other will be displayed.
<pre>
&ltlabel for="source"&gtHow did you hear about us?&lt/label&gt
&ltdatalist id="sources"&gt
    &ltselect name="source"&gt
        &ltoption&gtplease choose...&lt/option&gt
        &ltoption value="television"&gtTelevision&lt/option&gt
        &ltoption value="radio"&gtRadio&lt/option&gt
        &ltoption value="newspaper"&gtNewspaper&lt/option&gt
        &ltoption&gtOther&lt/option&gt
    &lt/select&gt
    If other, please specify:
&lt/datalist&gt
&ltinput id="source" name="source" list="sources"&gt
</pre>
This example came from Jeremy Keith’s website <a href='https://adactio.com/journal/4272/' target="_blank">here</a>.

</p>
<p>
I know what your thinking, that’s all find and dandy but what about my javascript? Javascript, as you surely know, is not fault tolerant. 
If you try to use a feature of javascript that the browser doesn’t understand, your page will break and your users will be mad at you personally 
while your co-workers mock you. 
This is why we <a href='http://responsivenews.co.uk/post/18948466399/cutting-the-mustard' target="_blank">“cut the mustard”</a>. Use javascript 
to see if a function is supported and run it if you can. Always have a HTML version that works 
without the javascript and let the javascript enhance the experience if it’s available.
To “cut the mustard”, if “querySelector” and “addEventListener” are in the document then you can run javascript.
</p>
<pre>
if ( 'querySelector' in document && 'addEventListener' in window ) {
// Scripts go here
}
</pre>
<a href='http://responsivenews.co.uk/post/18948466399/cutting-the-mustard' target="_blank">This</a> explains the method and why they chose those two fields.
<p>
By starting simple and cutting the mustard, you can build a robust website that is both past and future friendly.
</p>
<h4>Design for people, not just screens</h4>
<p>
I remember developing websites at 800 X 600 resolution and explaining to the client that this is the standard size for web pages. 
I also remember when the “standard size” moved to 1024 X 768. Although this may have worked in the past, it is not the way it is 
today. Two years ago, I wrote a media query targeting the iphone’s resolution. Today, there are 4 different screen sizes just for 
iphones. Then there’s all the different screen sizes for Samsung, Nokia, HTC, Blackberry and Windows phones (both of them) too. And don’t forget 
about tablets, mini tablets, chrome books, and tv’s. The line between devices have blurred out of existence therefore responsive 
web design is now a responsibility, not a feature. Having a separate domain for a mobile website or a mobile version is just a waste 
of time. Instead, make one responsive website work everywhere. Oh, and it's perfectly okay if your site doesn't look the same in every browser because that's what
they said and I believe them.
